# AER-HFIR-cycle-502

Simulations for the angle-encoded radiography experiment on the CG-4B beamline. Experiment scheduled for second half of cycle 502, which starts March 28th 2023.

The sample will be a borated aluminum diffraction grating which is currently at ISIS.

### To do list before experiment:

1. The tuning prodecure needs to be ironed out: SESANS tuning should get the field integral equal between the arms, but how can we ensure true angle encoding? How accurate does the encoding have to be? 
2. For beam line polarization, we will have a translation stage to measure the empty beam polarization, as we suspect that the beamline polarization will be a function of current in the MWPs.
3. Normalization would be nice to figure out analytically. Maybe look into literature?
4. Need to get the diffraction grating from ISIS when I go there next week. Steven Parnell might have it.
5. Try to automate image reconstruction algorithm. Try to fit the polarization even with the sample factor issue?
