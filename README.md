# AER-HFIR-cycle-502

Simulations for the angle-encoded radiography experiment on the CG-4B beamline. Experiment scheduled for second half of cycle 502, which starts March 28th 2023.
The cycle may be delayed for 2 weeks.

The sample will either be a 1mm borated aluminum diffraction grating or a Borated 3D printed 4mm or 2mm mask..

### Top priority:

1. The tuning prodecure needs to be ironed out: can we scan each MWP independently?
2. What's the best way of measuring beam polarization?
3. Image reconstruction and normalization is done.
4. Try to automate image reconstruction algorithm. Try to fit the polarization even with the sample factor issue?
